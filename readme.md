# KCD - Architect
 
A modification for Kingdom Come Deliverance which introduces base-building mechanics and new features to the game.

This project allows the construction of entities within the games world - 
this means that the player can spawn anything from simple props to flora & fauna, vegetation, houses, walls, towers,
tents, chairs, benches, beds, etc. anywhere in the world.

Make a backup of your saved games before doing anything else.  
Constructions are saved across your savegames - there is no new save required.  

There are _no DLCs required_ in order to use this mod.

If you're having fun with this mod you're maybe interested in buying me a coffee :)

Thanks to [Warhorse Studios](https://warhorsestudios.cz) for creating this gem!

## Installation
Download the latest release, unzip the archive into your KingdomComeDeliverance\mods - folder.
If the installation was succesful you'll see the instructions-message on how to use the mod when the game has been started
(and a savegame loaded or a new game hast been created).

### Using the devmode
You need to start the game with devmode enabled (the modification won't work otherwise).  
**In your OS / explorer / shell:** 
`<Steam>\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance\Bin\Win64\KingdomCome.exe -devmode`
  
### For Steam Users
The following list of files files need to be stored at: 
`Steam\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance\mods\architect\`
- mod.manifest
- keybinds.cfg
- Data\architect.pak

### For Epic Store Users
This will get updated soon - however, take a look at the posts section of this site - people using epic were also able to use this mod.

### Uninstall / Removal
Its also safe to remove the mod at any time (if you've already created something within the game, without
deleting it first, the entity stays in the game. Use **#deleteall()** within the ingame-console to clean up your scene.)
