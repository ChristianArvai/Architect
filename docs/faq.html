###### FAQ / Known problems :(
You should know that developing mods is just a really small side hobby of mine - so you have to experience bugs, crashes, lowered sleeping quality because of lost save games -
but im giving my best, however as always, create backups of whatever youre doing right now if possible. The following is a list of questions and answers and known problems :( of the project.

#####  The people are ignoring my constructions.
Yes that happens because, of an outdated navmesh (the thing npc's are actually moving on / with) - this cant be updated during runtime however.
But maybe there is a way to set up waypoints - we'll see!

##### The constructions are still available even though ive deleted the mod >:( !
Yes, this is true.

##### Vegetation and some other models arent removeable
Yes, this is also true.

##### I want feature x!
Me too! Write me a message!

##### I cant spawn any animals with this mod!
This is true but I never claimed this (but gamestar.deï»¿ did), however ill be thinking about this!

##### Nothing works!
This is too bad - you could take a look into your kcd.log file within your kingdom come folder and look for errors.

##### The user interface is so minimal! 
How dare you! This ui looks great! But you are correct its a bit work to 
scroll through the list - but there will be some kind of solution to this.

##### Are you some kind of wizard?
Yes and the people at [Warhorse Studios](https://warhorsestudios.cz) are!
