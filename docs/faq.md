###### FAQ / Known problems
You should know that developing mods is just a really small side hobby of mine - so you have to experience bugs, crashes, lowered sleeping quality because of lost save games -
but im giving my best, however as always, create backups of whatever youre doing right now if possible. The following is a list of questions and answers and known problems :( of the project.

#####  The people are ignoring my constructions.
Yes that happens because, of an outdated navmesh (the thing npc's are actually moving on / with) - this cant be updated during runtime however.
But maybe there is a way to set up waypoints - we'll see!

##### The constructions are still available even though ive deleted the mod >:( !
Yes, this is true.

##### Vegetation and some other models arent removeable
Yes, this is also true.

##### I want feature x!
Me too! Write me a message!

##### The constructions dont cast any shadows
This is true - message me if you know how to solve this issue.
There is a fix by saving and reloading the gamestate - this regenerates the Lightning.
