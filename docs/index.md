# Welcome!
This project introduces new features and mechanics to [kingdom come deliverance](https://www.kingdomcomerpg.com/) like a construction-system,
a resource-system, a basic crafting-system, town management, etc. 

This means that the player can create and spawn constructions - this ranges from simple props to flora & fauna, 
vegetation, houses, walls, towers, tents, chairs, benches, beds, etc. almost anywhere in the world. Its also possible to build 
custom constructions like wood-, stone-, coal-, ... -generators which produce resources or items over time.

<br>

## Installation
Get the latest release from [mods nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/958) or [github](https://github.com/benjaminfoo/Architect/releases), 
unzip the archive into your _'KingdomComeDeliverance\mods'_ - folder.  
If the installation was succesful you'll see the instructions-message on how to use the mod when the game has been started  
(and a savegame loaded or a new game hast been created).  

###  Using the devmode
You need to start the game with devmode enabled (the modification won't work otherwise).   
**In your OS / explorer / shell:**  
`<Steam>\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance\Bin\Win64\KingdomCome.exe -devmode`
  
### For Steam Users
The following list of files needed to be stored at:  
`Steam\steamapps\common\KingdomComeDeliverance\mods\architect\` 
- mod.manifest
- keybinds.cfg
- Data\architect.pak

### Other
As Im using the steam version I cant provide any details on using how to install and use the mod on the Epic Store or GoG -   
however, take a look at the nexusmods page because many users reported to get the modification to work. See this [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/958?tab=posts).


### Uninstall / Removal
Its also safe to remove the mod at any time (if you've already created something within the game, without
deleting it first, the entity stays in the game. Use **#deleteall()** within the ingame-console to clean up your scene.)


<br>

## Usage / Keys
These keys can be used to interact with the mod - they're also shown ingame.

<div class="preformat_code">
Choose the next construction
Button MouseWheel up  

Choose the previous construction
Button MouseWheel down  

Create a new construction  
Key V

Toggle rotation-mode for new construction
Key R
                
Remove a construction  
Key G

Enable / Disable the modification  
Key H

</div>

<br>

#### Change default key-bindings
The `keybinds.cfg` file contains all keybindings used in the project - change it to a key or a controller button as you like.

#### Add new constructions to the selection, remove constructions
Not every asset is referenced in the project, because some are not suitable (split into multiple parts which would be a 
pain to position by hand, some are graphical effects, some are too large to be positioned by the player, etc.).

However, one could add models / cgfs from the assets  on its own, 
the currently used constructions are listed in the file:   
[Data/Scripts/Manager/arc_BuildingsManager.lua](https://github.com/benjaminfoo/Architect/blob/master/Data/Scripts/Manager/arc_BuildingsManager.lua)

## Features

This is an overview of all the implemented features this project contains.

<div id="constructions"></div>
### Construction-System

One target functionality architect introduces is the concept of constructions.

<div class="preformat_code">
A construction is an entity within the cryengine
There are different kinds of properties an entity can use from

Construction, Construction-Properties
 - name (optional) - the name of the construction - the name will be built from the modelPath
 - modelPath       - the relative path to the *.cgf file, contains the name of the model file and its physics
 - description     - the description for the construction
 - groschenPrice   - the price in groschen the user has to pay upfront (to whom? who recieves this money) 
                     => maybe there should be some kind of logic that 50% goes to the king and 50% to the city, 
                        and at some point you will get the money back or something like that, 
                        some kind of insurence or something
 - sitable         - if true, the player can sit on this object
 - useable         - if true, the player can use the object in some way
 - saveable        - if true, the instance of the construction gets saved
 - cookingSpot        - if true, the player can use the construction for cooking
 - sleepable       - if true, the player can use the construction for sleeping

Properties related to generating some item over a specified amount of time
(like collecting water passively) or craft something out of x for y (x = generated item, y = cost of crafting for item x)
 - generator           - if true, the item generates items over time specified by following properties
 - generatorOnUse      - if true, the construction can be used by the player to generate an item
 - generatorItem       - the item that gets crafted on use or after time
 - generatorItemCosts  - the costs for producing this item (a set of resources and amounts)
 - generatorCooldown   - the length of the intervall after an item gets generated passievly
 - generatorItemAmount - the amount of items the user recieves after an intervall

Notes
- Constructions which only contain a modelPath are handled as static entites (no functionality, just a model + collider + manged in savegames)

</div>

<br>
<div id="townManagement"></div>

### Town management

Its possible to define basic attributes of a home or town now. 
You can set a home position and return back any time or set a name for your town.
There is also a statistics command which shows different aspects of your town.

Sets the current player-location as home / town  
`#setHome()`

Sets the town's name to Farkletown  
`#setHomeName("Farkletown")`

Returns the player to his home / town  
`#getHome()`
    
Displays a resume (a list of attributes, like name, town, generated resources) for your current town  
`#showStats()`

<br>

<div id="resourceManagement"></div>
### Resource Management
Another new feature architect introduces is the management of resources. 

There are different kinds of resources:

<div class="preformat_code">
resources = {

    -- basic resources
    wood = 0,
    stone = 0,

    -- basic needs
    food = 0,
    water = 0,

    -- the money of the user, this should be bind to the actuals player value
    groschen = 0,

    -- this can be used for baking bread or other food in kingdom come deliverance
    wheat = 0,

    coal = 0,
    cords = 0,
    linen = 0,
} 

</div>
Building constructions will require the user to spend money and / or resources in order to actually built something - 
like the ingredients of a recipe. The implementation is not finished yet.

<br>

<div id="customCrafting"></div>
### Custom Crafting
A construction who posses attributes like generatorOnUse can be used to realize simple crafting mechanics.
<div class="preformat_code">
{
    -- create a new construction which can be used for crafting
    modelPath = "...",
    generatorOneUse = true
    generatorItem = "wood"
    -- TODO
} 

</div>

.. this needs further updates.

<br>

## Current features / To-Dos / bugs
This list contains all the features planned for later development, recommended by myself or the community:

- resource / cost management system (for spending and recieving groschen w constructions)
  - needs balancing
  - implement costs for crafting or producing resources or items
  - implement costs for building stuff, should be in the recipe above!
  
   
- custom crafting systems 
  - needs balancing
  - implement costs for crafting or producing resources or items
  - implement costs for building stuff, should be in the recipe above! 
  
  
- add further constructions
  - a working kitchen / campfire
  - trigger / buttons
  
- misc  
  - Implement ladders
  - spawn setups with relations to npcs or items
  - make torches & lights toggleable
  - ... siege invasions ... ?
  
<br>  
<br>

  
## Technical
This is an overview of all the available console- and lua- commands this project contains.

### Console commands
The following list contains regular console commands

- architect_help - show the help menu (also shows all available lua functionality)
- architect_clear - clear the ingame console
- architect_gamble - win or loose 5 groschen!
- architect_log - print some text to the ingame-console
- architect_recompileAll - reload the source-code of the project


### Lua functions
These functions offer advanced usage to the modifications internals, use at your own risk and save the game. \
**In order to execute a lua function, you have to prepend a '#'-character to execute it.**

<div class="preformat_code">
All commands are available in upper / lowercase format.

#search(string s) 
-- Search for entites which name contains string s
-- For example: #search("stone") - emits a list of entities containing the string "stone"
-- Use Select to use one of your findings (without using the mouse wheel)

#select(nr)
-- selects the construction at Number nr and updates the user interface

#selectFirst()  
-- selects the first construction and updates the user interface

#selectLast()
-- selects the last construction and updates the user interface

#showall() 
-- lists all constructions to the ingame console

#deleteall()
-- deletes all constructions you've created

#deleteAt(index)()
-- delete the construction at number index (use #showall())

#toggleEntityLock()
-- toggles the deletion_lock-value of the currently faced entity
-- If true, the entity wont get deleted, no matter which function / mechanism is used,
-- if false, the entity will get deleted (default) 

#reloadall()
-- Reloads the source files of the project at runtime

#rayCastHit()
-- Use a raycast to determine entities in front of the player

#lockAll()
-- locks all constructions from the user
-- by pressing 'O' you're locking the currently faced entity, which makes it undeleteable, press again to retoggle the state
-- this method is useful when used after loading a saved game - this way you can keep your changes 

#unlockAll()
-- unlocks all constructions from the user

#setHome()
-- Sets the current player-location as home / town

#setHomeName("Farkletown")
-- Sets the town's name

#getHome()
-- Returns the player to his home / town
    
#showStats()
-- Displays a resume (a list of attributes, like name, town, generated resources) for your current town

<br>  
  
<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/howto/001_help.jpg">  
There are new methods in order to look for constructions like `#search(''), #select(nr), ...`
  
<br>

<br>  
  
<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/howto/006_search_and_Select.jpg">  
Its also possible to wrap multiple method calls, like `#select(search("smithery")` which search and returns the first construction
which contains "smithery" as a part of its name.

<br>  

### Locking
<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/howto/010_locking.jpg">  
Use `#lockAll()` to activate the deletion-lock of all constructions.

<br>  
  

<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/howto/011_unlocking.jpg">  
Use `#unlockAll()` to deactivate the deletion-lock of all constructions.
  
<br>

Use `#showStats()` to get an overview of the towns name, owner, position, resources, ...

<br>  
 
<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/howto/021_stats.jpg">  
... and for an overview of all existing generators, etc. 

<br>  

<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/howto/030_home_setHome.jpg">
